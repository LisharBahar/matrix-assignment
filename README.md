# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Token
This server generates a token when it is restarted using a stub user details Index.js file and logs it to the console. Make sure to save the token for all future requests!
This token should be inserted for using this app via Swagger UI. Paste the token generated in the "Authorize" popup prompt.

### Running the server
To run the server locally, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

To run the server via Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Testing
To test the api POST method run:
```
npm test
```

** I've made the math/POST method async even though it's not necessary

## Run
Feel free to test our awesome math calculator by sending a POST request to '/math' route.
Please don't forget to include params:
```
{ num1: <SOME_NUMBER>, num2: <SOME_NUMBER>}
```
Additinally you need to add an HttpHeader named 'operation' with one of the following mathematical methods:
```
'add' | 'subtract' | 'multiply' | 'divide'
```
