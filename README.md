# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Token
This server generates a token each time it is restarted using a random User Id syntax demonstrated in the Index.js file. Make sure to save the token for all future requests!

### Running the server
To run the server locally, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

To run the server via Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
